Where: Fork of https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-pong. 
What: Code was used for the base gameplay and set up
Why: So that we could focus on the input method and sensor testing rather than game mechanics.

Canvas Pong
===========

This is a small experiment to implement a version of the classic Pong game in an HTML <canvas>.

 * You can find the [game here](http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/5/14/javascript_pong/demo.html)
 * You can find out [how it works](http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/5/14/javascript_pong/index.html)

You can also play this game in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omimkinlomnncbmnceacpkmlbfaapojj?hl=en-US)


NOTES
=====

 * No support for mobile devices (need to handle touch events instead of key input)
